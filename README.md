### Autism Detection

The autism detection project aimed to identify early signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children using machine learning techniques. The analysis focused on understanding the relationships between various questionnaire responses and the risk of ASD.

#### Key Findings:

1. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - The correlation matrix revealed that questions Q22 and Q25 had the highest positive correlation with ASD risk, with correlation scores of 0.3 and 0.25, respectively.
   - Further analysis identified significant correlations between specific pairs of questions that contribute to the ASD determination spectrum:
     - Q2 and Q1: 0.67
     - Q5 and Q1: 0.47
     - Q5 and Q2: 0.46
     - Q6 and Q5: 0.62
   These correlations indicate that these questions are strong indicators of ASD when considered together.

2. **Model Performance:**
   - Among the various machine learning algorithms applied, logistic regression demonstrated superior performance.
   - The logistic regression model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 94.12%, making it the most effective model for predicting ASD risk in this study.

#### Conclusion:

The project successfully utilized machine learning to enhance the early detection of autism in children. By analyzing the correlations between questionnaire responses and leveraging logistic regression, the study provided a robust method for identifying potential ASD cases with high accuracy. These findings could be instrumental in developing early intervention strategies and improving outcomes for children at risk of autism.
